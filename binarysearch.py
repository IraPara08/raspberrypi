1. Let min = 0 and max = n-1.
2. If max < min, then stop: target is not present in array. Return -1.
3. Compute guess as the average of max and min, rounded down (so that it is an integer).
4. If array[guess] equals target, then stop. You found it! Return guess.
5. If the guess was too low, that is, array[guess] < target, then set min = guess + 1.
6. Otherwise, the guess was too high. Set max = guess - 1.
7. Go back to step 2
